# Simple image classifier using telegram

This project uses telegram to send images to an image classifier driven by pre-trained tensorflow model - see here [Tensorflow.js Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd).

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies
```
$ yarn
```

2. Get Telegram token - see [here](https://core.telegram.org/)

3. Clone `.env.example` to `.env` and add your freshly generated BOT_TOKEN.

4. Run `node index.js` from your root directory.

5. Send your freshly generated telegram bot some pictures and let him discover the objects in the picture.
